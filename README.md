# Usage
## Downloading FEAL_AEM

## Compile and build
### Prerequisites
Prerequisites to compile FEAL_AEM are as follows:
+ MPI
+ METIS
+ MUMPS
+ Compiler

### Compile and build
+ Build FEAL_AEM

+ Build an example problem after build FEAL_AEM

+ Build all

## Mores on compile option

### Running the example

# Folder structure
+ `src` : source files of FEAL_AEM 1.0.
+ `example` : source files of an example problem for 3D vector-wave equation.
+ `include` : header files are created after building.
+ `lib` : a static library of FEAL_AEM 1.0 is are created after building
+ `doc` : documentation
+ `run` : an executable binary file for the example problem is created after building.
+ `tool` : contains useful scripts and tools.
